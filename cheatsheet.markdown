# Vim Cheat Sheet
Just a list of the hard-to-forget but easy-to-love commands and shortcuts that I
find.

| Command      | What is happened                  |
|--------------|-----------------------------------|
| `^w then ^w` | Cycle through open splits         |
| cc           | Delete line and enter insert mode |
| cw           | Change word                       |
