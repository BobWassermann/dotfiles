# Vim Cheat Sheet
Just a list of the hard-to-remember but easy-to-love commands and shortcuts that I
find.

| Command            | What is happened                  |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------|
| `^w then ^w`       | Cycle through open splits         |
| `cc`               | Delete line and enter insert mode |
| `cw`               | Change word                       |
| `^w then =`        | Make all splits equal in size     |
| `gg=G`             | Reindent the file                 |
| `"+y`              | Copy to the system clipboard      |
| `:%s/find/replace` | Global find and replace           |
