# Dotfiles: The Dan Eden Story

I have no idea what I’m doing, but with any luck, that’ll change the more I use my own dotfiles.

## Installation

1. In your home folder, run `git clone --recursive git@github.com:daneden/dotfiles .dotfiles`
2. Navigate to the cloned directory and run `./make.sh`
3. Party.
