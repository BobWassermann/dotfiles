# Dotfiles: The Dan Eden Story

I have no idea what I’m doing, but with any luck, that’ll change the more I use my own dotfiles.

## Instructions
For the time-being, this repo is for Dan eyes only, but that doesn’t mean I won’t forget how to use it.

These instructions assume a few things, namely access to private repos and zsh set as the shell.

1. In your home folder, run `git clone --recursive git@github.com:daneden/dotfiles .dotfiles`
2. Navigate to the cloned directory and run `make.sh`
3. Party.
